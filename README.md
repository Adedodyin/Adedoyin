## Introduction
Founded in 2013, Bellabeat is a successful small high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products.
The Co-Founder wants to focus on one Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices. 
The chosen device for this analysis is the Bellabeat App which provides users with health data related to their activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits.

* Business Task: Analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices.
* Problem: How can Bellabeat incorporate insights from  smart device usage into their products?
