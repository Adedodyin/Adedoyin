I have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. \nThe insights I discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. I will then present the analysis to the Bellabeat executive team along with high-level recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.\n\n### 1.3 Company History\n\nFounded in 2013, Bellabeat is a successful small a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products.\nBellabeat products became available through a growing number of online retailers in addition to their own e-commerce channel on their website.\n\n### 1.4 Executive Concern\n\nThe Co-founder and Chief Creative Officer asked the marketing analytics team to focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices. \nThen, using this information, she would like high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy. \n\nThe chosen device for this analysis is the Bellabeat App that provides users with health data related to their activity, sleep, stress,\nmenstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits.","metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2 ASK PHASE\n### 2.1 Guiding Questions\n\n1.

The Bellabeat app should recommend the total recommended steps to be walked in a day so users can make sure to walk these steps and also promote their enthusiasm by coming up with a weekly scoreboard that users can compete for. \n2. The Bellabeat app can be used by users to improve their sleep patterns by analyzing their sleep patterns and suggesting suitable times for them to sleep so they can get the most sleep recommended. \n3. The Bellabeat app can help the users reduce their sedentary time by suggesting activities to be done instead and also providing articles on health benefits of having shorter sedentary time through pop-notifications.\n4. Bellabeat app can suggest activities to the users on the days when they are least active and also send users articles on benefits of being active.\n\n\nThese are my recommendations for Bellabeat to incorporate which answers the business question. \n\n![Thank you.](https://media.giphy.com/media/wIVA0zh5pt0G5YtcAL/giphy.gif)","metadata":{}}]}
